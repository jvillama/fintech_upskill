- Work on Module 18: Blockchain with Python
    - Record-keeping system in a decentralized way.
    - Deploy the decentralized blockchain through a web application so that anyone can review and use it.
    - A blockchain is a technology that records and shares data over a network, such as the internet.
    - The system is designed so that the remaining blockchains—replicated on potentially thousands or millions more computers—will automatically identify the compromised blockchains as invalid. So, distributed blockchain technology has a built-in auditing system.
    - Streamlit web application server and webpage display functionality
    - Creating a Blockchain Block with a Python Data Class
    - Hashing is a cryptography technique that takes a piece of input data and then outputs a fixed-length, mathematical representation of that data—a hash.
    - Create a new block of data and display the hash for that block.
    - Build a Streamlit application that can both generate new blocks of user data and add them to a Python blockchain
    - Issue encountered 18.2.9 Activity: Blockchain Application

        must be added to `~/.streamlit/config.toml`
    - Consensus mechanisms use protocols and algorithms to achieve a consensus about the state of the system. While many approaches exist for reaching a consensus.
        - Two of the most common consensus algorithms are proof of work and proof of stake.
    - Validating the Blockchain
